                <h1>2019-2020 Australian Bush Fires (Near Real Time Data)</h1>
                <p>The Australian bush fire had been devastating. It has caused
                    <br>massive loss of wildlife, forest land, and has even to
                    <br>led human casualties. There have been huge undertakings by the
                    <br>fire department on controlling the bushfire and recovery activity.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thanks to NASA the satellite data by MODIS and VIIRS,
                    <br>near real-time data is made available publically.
                    <br>The Near Real Time (NRT) data is between January 1st, 2020 to January 31th, 2020.

                <p>Bullying statistics across Victoria vary greatly, with some correlation to location. In most regions,
                    neighbouring LGAs have similar bullying rates and Metropolitan Melbourne has lower rates than in
                    Regional
                    Victoria.
                    However, in 2016, the LGA with the highest reported rate (30.5%), Northern Grampians near the
                    western border,
                    is directly adjacent to the LGA with the lowest rate (Southern Grampians, 4.3%). </p>

                <p>
                    Here, the correlation is more apparent. The LGAs that
                    perform better on the NAPLAN tests tend to have less bullying, across all years. This indicates that
                    children
                    who
                    apply themselves at school and/or environments that value education result in less bullying in
                    class.</p>

                    <h2>Trends across Genders</h2>
                    <p>One interesting trend is that bullying rates have decreased across the years in all regions and
                        genders. Of
                        note
                        is that the bullying rate in boys is now 1.9% lower than that in girls, despite starting 2.2%
                        higher. This
                        change
                        occurred between 2010 and 2011. We speculate that this may be due to the popularisation of
                        social media
                        around this
                        time, allowing for different avenues of bullying, such as cyberbullying, to emerge. </p>

                    <h2>Melbourne Metro Region</h2>
                    <p>The Melbourne metropolitan region has generally reported lower bullying rates than across the
                        state,
                        despite
                        having a range of NAPLAN scores (see above). This may be due to a variety of factors as any
                        factor that
                        attracts
                        families to the city could be an explanation. Some possible examples are the parents education
                        and
                        profession,
                        the funding of the school in question, or even the immigration status of students.

                    <p>
                        Within metropolitan Melbourne, KNOX reported the most bullying in 2016 at 22.6%, and Stonnington
                        the least
                        at 6%.</p>
